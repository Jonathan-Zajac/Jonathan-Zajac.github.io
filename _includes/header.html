            <h1>Computational Biophysics & Molecular Design</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Jonathan. I am a computational molecular scientist interested in the structure, function, 
                and dynamics of biomolecular systems. I'm an enthusiast of observing proteins wiggle and jiggle, using 
                molecular simulations to understand the physical principles underlying biological systems. I develop and 
                leverage methods combining statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, machine learning, and enhanced sampling
                to investigate complex systems.
            </p>
            <p>Currently, I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota,
                advised by Professor Sapna Sarupria. My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods
                to study protein-solvent interactions towards the design of stable biological formulations.
